- 👋 Hi, I’m @lyricalsoul (a.k.a. [@blueslimee](https://github.com/blueslimee) - lost my 2FA backup code for that account. oops!);
- 👀 I’m interested in Swift, TypeScript, Elixir and Rust;
- 🌱 I focus on backend development, specially on high-availability applications;
- 🙋 I speak Portuguese, English, Spanish and I am trying to learn Korean;
- 🥁 I develop random stuff - most of the times chatbots (such as [lastgram](https://github.com/musicorum-app/lastgram) - the last.fm bot for telegram) and other cool stuff (such as [ditto](https://github.com/musicorum-app/ditto), a high-speed service for image generation);
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - through Twitter ([@kuntmermaid](https://twitter.com/kuntmermaid)),
  - through Discord ([blueslimee#0511](https://discord.com/users/918911149595045959)),
